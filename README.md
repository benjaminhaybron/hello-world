This repository is for practicing the Github Flow.

My enthusiasm for cybersecurity is driven by a background in troubleshooting complex mechanical and electrical systems. The attention to detail, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills I developed are directly applicable to identifying and mitigating cybersecurity threats. I am excited to leverage these strengths to help an organization achieve its goal of a resilient and secure digital environment.
